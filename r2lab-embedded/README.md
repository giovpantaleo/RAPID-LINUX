# Purpose

This repository contains the code designed to be used in operations on
the various pieces of the R2lab testbed, typically
* users and root environment on the gateway and infrastructure
* user environment on nodes
* user environment on (mac)phones
* tools for building images

It is designed to be small, and the corresponding public git repo acts
like a software distribution hub. In this respect, it comes with
shortcuts (shell functions) that can be used to update itself.

# History

This contents used to be part of a wider repo at
https://github.com/parmentelat/r2lab/infra **old location**

But that one became way too large over time, and it bacame apparent
that a split was required, if only so that updates could run more
efficiently

## Legacy

It won't be possible to update all the r2lab images to reflect
this change, at least not overnight.

For that reason, the big `r2lab` repo is still available but was
archived under github.
